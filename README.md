Scotland Weather Control Center — 3D Live Weather Dashboard
This project is a fully interactive, 3D‑styled weather intelligence dashboard built for key Scottish cities. It combines real‑time weather data, radar layers, atmospheric calculations, and a custom UI design into a single cloud‑hosted application. The dashboard is powered by the OpenWeather API and deployed globally using AWS S3 and CloudFront.

🚀 Overview
The Scotland Weather Control Center provides a modern, high‑contrast interface that displays live weather conditions, radar layers, and a detailed atmospheric profile. It includes a 3D visual representation of Scotland, animated UI elements, and a clean layout designed for clarity and operational awareness.
The dashboard updates in real time using the OpenWeather API and allows users to switch between major Scottish cities to view localized conditions.

⚙️ How It Works
Weather Data Fetching
The dashboard retrieves:
- Current weather
- 5‑day forecast
- Radar tile layers
based on the selected city’s coordinates.
Atmospheric Calculations
The application computes:
- Dew point
- Cloud base height
- Human‑readable condition tags
These values are derived from temperature, humidity, and other API data.
Radar Layers
Leaflet loads OpenWeather tile layers with adjustable opacity to create a smooth meteorological map experience.
Cloud Deployment
The project is hosted on AWS S3 and distributed globally through CloudFront. Cache invalidation ensures that updates to the dashboard appear instantly.

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adeyeyesamuel409-svg/scotland-weather-control-center.git
cd scotland-weather-control-center


2. Add your OpenWeather API key
Inside index.html, replace:
const API_KEY = "33ced6a4eb0fdc5612a9964507e843d8";
const TILE_API_KEY = "33ced6a4eb0fdc5612a9964507e843d8";


3. Deploy to AWS S3
Upload index.html to your S3 bucket.
4. Invalidate CloudFront Cache
In CloudFront → Invalidations:
/*


5. Open your CloudFront URL
Your dashboard is now live.
